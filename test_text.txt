My only love, sprung from my only hate!

Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

¡°Do you understand what that means?¡± I asked, thinking he had a question.

¡°Yes,¡± he said. ¡°I think it¡¯s very beautiful.¡±

I paused and looked at the lines again.

¡°I think you¡¯re right,¡± I said, and for a moment neither of us said anything.

Together Silence Hill and I stood there looking at the poetry.

2.1 RAISE THE FLAG MOUNTAINTHE MOUNTAIN HAS TWO NAMES, Peach Blossom Mountain and Raise theFlag Mountain, and it rises green above the college and the junction of therivers. In spring and fall and winter, the peak often fades into the rivervalleyfog, and in summer, when the days burn bright under a violent sun,the groves of peach trees near the summit seem to shiver in the heat.

The blossoms appear in late March or early April, two brief pink-floweredweeks that give the mountain its first name. But almost nobody in Fulingcalls it Peach Blossom Mountain, although the origins of the other title areeven more fleeting¡ªa single instant during the nineteenth-century TaipingRebellion, when China¡¯s history came to Fuling, marched up the mountain,and then moved on. This was perhaps the only time when Fuling was closeto the center of China¡¯s affairs, and after more than a century the echo stillremains, the mountain¡¯s name a memorial to a strange and violent revolution.

The Great Taiping Rebellion was started in the mid-1840s by Hong Xiuquan,a poor man from Guangxi province who, frustrated by failing theChinese civil service examination four times, decided that he was the Sonof God and the younger brother of Jesus Christ. After that, things happenedvery quickly. By 1851, Hong Xiuquan was leading twenty thousandarmed followers, and he declared that he was the Heavenly King of a new dynasty.

His soldiers let their hair grow long, fought without fear of death, andbelieved a sort of bastardized fundamentalist Protestantism that was basedloosely on foreign missionary tracts. In 1853, they captured the eastern cityof Nanjing, calling it their New Jerusalem, and in time Hong Xiuquan ruledalmost half of China.

The Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace¡ªTaiping Tianguo¡ªwas opposedto opium, foot binding, prostitution, gambling, and tobacco, and it had somesupport from the Chinese peasants, who had no affection for the corruptQing Dynasty rulers. But Hong Xiuquan and the other revolutionary leaderslacked the vision and experience to run a country, and power tempted most ofthem into luxury and infighting. They began to acquire the trappings of thedynasty they hoped to overthrow: robes of yellow silk, hordes of sycophants,endless concubines. But they were still too powerful to be defeated by theQing, and the Taipings held Nanjing even while engaging in increasinglybloody internecine power struggles.

Hong Xiuquan¡¯s greatest general was Shi Dakai, who was known as theWing King, Lord of Five Thousand Years. Of all the original leaders, hewas the most capable, and his disillusionment with the Taiping infightingfinally pushed him to leave Nanjing in 1857. Leading 100,000 soldiers, heembarked on a military campaign that spanned six years and foreshadowedthe sweeping troop movements of the Communist Long March. His Taipingarmy zigzagged across eastern and southern China, arriving eventually at theYangtze River valley. In time they came to Fuling, where Shi Dakai and hissoldiers marched up the long even slope of Peach Blossom Mountain, andthere, at the summit, they raised the flag of the Heavenly Kingdom.

FROM THE SUMMIT of Raise the Flag Mountain, all of Fuling can be seenon a clear day. But in the fall, when the seasonal rains and mists sit heavyabove the rivers, there are days when the view is blocked by clouds, and thecity across the Wu is nothing but sound: horns and motors and constructionprojects echoing up through the heavy white fog. Sometimes the mist willstay for days or even weeks. But then something clears the valleys¡ªa shiftin temperature, a stiff breeze¡ªand suddenly the view opens.

Southward the mountain falls away steeply to valleys of terraced cropland,and near the Wu River the land is broken by the settlements of the EastRiver district: the college, looking small with the distance; the ceramics factory,its stacks spewing yellow dust into the air; the long concrete pier andthe old ferries that traverse the Wu. The river lies slack, like a long thin boltof gray silk unrolled between the hills.

In the mist the city looks dirty and old, its buildings flung carelessly acrossthe hills, and it also looks big. Seen from ground level it is impossible to gainperspective on Fuling¡¯s size, but from Raise the Flag Mountain the scale ofthe city is suddenly apparent. The gray buildings are piled off far into thehorizon, past the distant needlelike spire of the Monument to the RevolutionaryMartyrs. And yet by Chinese standards it is a small city¡ªa town,really¡ªand all around the jumbled buildings the mountains are green andimpressive.

But none of them is truly wild. The view from Raise the Flag Mountainextends for perhaps six miles in every direction, and in that range nearly everyinch of useful soil is under cultivation. The same is true for the mountainitself: the peak is an orchard, a garden, an enormous farm lying on its side,the slope broken into steps and terraces that turn the hillside into level land.

Peach and orange groves are planted along the summit, where the mountainis too steep for terracing. A bit lower, the slope decreases and the peasantshave carved the land into short shelves for vegetables¡ªcabbage, potatoes,soybeans, radishes. Even lower, the terraces broaden enough for graincrops, and now in the fall it is almost time to plant the winter wheat. Thepeasants will sow the crop in November and December, and between everytwo or three rows they will leave a space of two feet. In March, two monthsbefore the wheat is harvested, they will plant corn in the spaces between therows. No land is wasted, and nothing is rushed or delayed; everything hasits season, and every season rests on the simple work that the peasants dowith their hands.

Farther down the mountain, the rice paddies were harvested weeks ago;now the fields are dry, and yellow stubble pokes up from the dirt. Most ofthe paddies sit in the low valley of the mountain¡¯s southern flank, where theland flattens enough to be shaped into broad sweeping terraces that can holdwater. Of all the mountain¡¯s crops, rice has the most intricate routines. It issowed in March, planted densely in seedbeds, and then the following monththe green shoots are uprooted and moved by hand to flooded paddies. InJuly and August, the crop is harvested and threshed, and the dry paddy canbe used for vegetables or winter wheat. And so the cycle continues, seasonafter season, year after year, and sometimes a single plot of land will see afull year¡¯s crops: rice to vegetables, vegetables to wheat, wheat to rice oncemore.

The lower mountain is cut by a dusty road near the Wu River. Belowthe road, the hillside falls away steeply, but even this floodland is used forwinter potatoes and mustard tuber. The small plots continue all the way tothe rocky banks of the Wu, where an old rusted boat approaches the junctionof the rivers. The craft¡¯s low front deck is empty of cargo, and from the cabinflutters a red Chinese flag. The boat reaches the Yangtze, spinning to facethe river¡¯s flow. Its motor wheezes. For an instant it pauses, fixed by thecurrent¡ªbelow the mountain, in front of the city, caught in the junction ofthe two rivers. Then the propeller catches hold of the fast-moving Yangtzeand the boat putters upstream.

SHI DAKAI AND HIS MEN followed the river valley west from Fuling.

They marched past Chongqing and Luzhou, and then they left the Yangtzeand entered the mountains of western Sichuan. By now it had been yearssince the march began, and in Nanjing the Heavenly Kingdom was in shambles,and finally the brave expedition became a retreat.

The army followed the banks of the Dadu, a mountain river in westernSichuan whose water runs green with glacial melt. The river had seen greatbattles before¡ªcritical campaigns were pitched there in the Three KingdomsPeriod, sixteen centuries earlier. And now the Qing government forces werein close pursuit, hoping to trap Shi Dakai and his men in the narrow valleys.

The year was 1863.

They paused for three days on the banks of the river to mark the birth ofShi Dakai¡¯s son. The rituals were elaborate, because the boy was a prince inthe Heavenly Kingdom¡ªthe son of the Wing King, the Lightning of the HolySpirit, the Lord of Five Thousand Years. But the Heavenly Kingdom wasalready fading into history, and Shi Dakai¡¯s five thousand years would be cutshort. The delay at the Dadu proved fatal; the Qing army cornered the rebels,and Shi Dakai surrendered after making sure that his five wives and childrenhad been put to death as painlessly as possible. He begged his captors toexecute him instead of his faithful followers, whose ranks had already shrunkfrom the original 100,000 to two thousand men. The Qing commanderslistened patiently to Shi Dakai¡¯s request, and then they massacred the Taipingtroops and dismembered the Wing King, slowly.

Seventy-two years later, Mao Zedong led his Communist forces to thesame river during the heart of the Long March. The Kuomintang was onthe verge of destroying the Red Army, and the lessons of history taught Maonot to delay. His troops moved steadily northward, until at Luding theycame to an ancient iron bridge across the Dadu that was well defended byKuomintang forces. The situation appeared hopeless.

Thirty Red soldiers volunteered. Under machine-gun fire they crawledacross the bridge, hand over hand, iron link by iron link, and against all oddsthey succeeded in capturing the enemy gun nests. The entire Communistarmy crossed the river victoriously, having survived what turned out to bethe most critical battle of the Long March. Later that year, eight thousandof Mao¡¯s men, all that remained from an initial force of eighty thousand,finished their trek in northern Shaanxi province. They established a base andsteadily grew in power, conquering the nation village by village, province byprovince; and in every town they spread their doctrine, which was a sort ofbastardized Marxism based loosely on the Soviet model. Fourteen years later,in 1949, Mao Zedong established the People¡¯s Republic of China.

The Communists opposed opium, foot binding, prostitution, and gambling,and they had a great deal of support from the Chinese peasants, whohad no affection for the grasping landlords and the corruption of the Kuomintang.

But Mao lacked the vision and experience necessary to run a countryeffectively, and power inspired him to build a cult of state-worship aroundhis image. The leading cadres began to acquire the luxurious trappings of thecorrupt reign they had over-thrown: great mansions, hordes of sycophants,endless concubines.

But even in the late 1990s, as stories of corruption are rife and the country¡¯seconomy quickly privatizes, the official view of history holds steady.

The Communist vision of the past idealizes peasant revolts like the GreatTaiping Rebellion, until even a remote place like Fuling has a stone statueof Shi Dakai in the public park. Some aspects of the movement, in contrast,have been allowed to fade¡ªChinese history books say little about the Taipings¡¯

strange brand of Christianity, and many students in a place like Fulingdon¡¯t know that Hong Xiuquan believed himself to be the younger brotherof Jesus Christ. But students know that he was a peasant revolutionary, andthat Mao succeeded where Hong Xiuquan failed. Such echoes are seen asevidence of legitimacy rather than signs that Chinese history, like the land,sometimes follows a pattern of cycles.

The Dadu River runs south to Leshan, where it enters the Min River underthe sightless gaze of the largest carved Buddha in the world. The Min flowssouthwest to Yibin, where it enters the Yangtze, and from there the river runswest and north for three hundred miles until it passes the green terracedslopes of Raise the Flag Mountain. Today there is no flag on the roundedpeak. The two-named mountain looms large above the river, its solid bulkrecalling the words that the Sichuan poet Du Fu wrote more than a thousandyears ago:

The state is shattered;Mountains and rivers remain.

3 RunningIN THE MORNINGS I often ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain.

As I ran, I studied the propaganda signs along the route, although at thebeginning there wasn¡¯t much about them that was recognizable. There werethree signs on the road out to the mountain, and to me they looked like this:

I finished my runs back in the center of campus, not far from the teachingbuilding, where a stone wall served as a backdrop for an inscription of threefoot-high characters:

That was how Chinese appeared in my first few months. I arrived inFuling able to recognize about forty characters, all of them simple: people,middle, country, above, below, long, man, woman. There hadn¡¯t been timefor more; the Peace Corps had given us an intensive course during our twomonths of training in Chengdu, but the emphasis was on learning enoughspoken Mandarin to function. We had to study written Chinese on our own,and until I got to Fuling I simply hadn¡¯t had enough time.

I came to Sichuan because I wanted to teach, but I also had two othermotivations: I thought the experience would make me a better writer, and Iwanted to learn Chinese. These were very clear goals, but the way to achievethem was much less obvious. I hoped the writing would take care of itself¡ªIwould keep my eyes open and take notes, and eventually, when I felt I wasready, I would start to write. But Chinese was a different matter altogetherand I had never undertaken something like that before.

That was one reason I had decided to come to China with the Peace Corps,because I knew they would try to teach me the 45 language. Their Chengdutraining course had been excellent; the classes were small and the teachersexperienced, and it had been easy to make progress. In Fuling, though, languagestudy was my own affair. The Peace Corps would pay for tutors, butI had to find them myself, and I had to decide which textbooks I would useand how I would structure my studies. It was a daunting task¡ªessentially, Ihad to figure out how to learn Chinese.

For the first few weeks, Dean Fu searched for tutors who could help Adamand me. He was as lost as we were¡ªhe had never known a foreigner who wastrying to learn the language, and I suspected that secretly he felt the projectwas hopeless. Waiguoren couldn¡¯t learn Chinese¡ªeverybody in Fuling knewthat. Our students found it hilarious that we even tried. They would ask meto speak a little Chinese, or write a character or two, and then they wouldlaugh at my efforts. At first this didn¡¯t bother me, but quickly it becameannoying. They thought I was dabbling in the language when in fact I wasserious: I knew that studying Chinese was one of the most important things Icould do in Fuling. So much depended on knowing the language¡ªmy friendships,my ability to function in the city, my understanding of the place.

I also wanted to learn Chinese out of stubbornness, because as a waiguorenyou weren¡¯t expected to do that. Such low expectations had a long tradition;even as late as the early 1800s it had been illegal for a Chinese to teach thelanguage to foreigners, and a number of Chinese were imprisoned and evenexecuted for tutoring young Englishmen. This bit of history fascinated me:

how many languages had been sacred and forbidden to outsiders? Certainly,those laws had been changed more than a century ago, but China was stillambivalent about opening to the outside world and language was still at theheart of this issue. In good conscience I could not live there for two yearsand not learn to speak Chinese. To me, this was as important as fulfilling myobligations as a teacher.

But this need wasn¡¯t nearly as obvious to everybody else. Dean Fu took along time finding tutors, and perhaps he was hoping that we¡¯d forget aboutit. We didn¡¯t need Chinese to teach, after all, and we already knew enoughto buy groceries and eat at local restaurants. That should be adequate, peoplefigured. In some respects, we were seen as English-teaching machines,or perhaps farm animals¡ªexpensive and skittish draft horses that taught literatureand culture. We were given cadres¡¯ apartments, and we had ourown Changhong-brand color televisions with remote. Our bedrooms wereair-conditioned. Each of us had a good kitchen and two beautiful balconies.

Our students were obedient and respectful. It didn¡¯t matter that, even as wewere given all of these things, the leaders also gave quiet instructions to ourcolleagues and students that they should avoid associating with us outsideof class. Waiguoren were risky, especially with regard to politics, and in anycase we didn¡¯t need close friends in the college. We could teach during theday and return to our comfortable cages at night, and, if we needed friendship,we always had each other. They even gave us telephones so we couldcall Peace Corps volunteers who lived in other parts of Sichuan.

Some of the more insightful students sensed that this did not make a fulllife. In his journal, Soddy wrote me a short note, politely addressed in thethird person:

Pete and Adam come to our college to teach our English without pay. Weare thankful for this behavior. But we are worried about Pete and Adam¡¯slives. For example: Pete and Adam know little Chinese, so they can¡¯t watchChinese TV programmes. I think your lives are difficult. I want to know howyou spend your spare time.

It was a good question. My teaching and preparation time rarely tookmuch more than thirty hours a week. I ran in the mornings, and sometimesI went for walks in the hills. Adam and I played basketball and threwthe Frisbee. I wrote on my computer. I planned other diversions for the future¡ªsubjects I wanted to cover in class, possible travel destinations. Mostly,though, I knew that there was plenty of exploring to be done in the city, butat the beginning this was the hardest place of all to open up.

Downtown Fuling looked good from my balcony. Often I¡¯d gaze acrossthe Wu River at the maze of streets and stairways, listening to the distanthum of daily life, and I¡¯d think about the mysteries that were hidden in theriver town. I wanted to investigate all of it¡ªI wanted to go down to thedocks and watch the boats; I wanted to talk with the stick-stick soldiers; Iwanted to explore the network of tangled staircases that ran through theold part of town. I longed to figure out how the city worked and what thepeople thought, especially since no foreigner had done this before. It wasn¡¯tlike living in Beijing or Shanghai, where there were plenty of waiguorenwho had discovered what the city had to offer. As far as foreigners wereconcerned, Fuling was our city¡ªor it would be once we figured it out.

But once I got there it didn¡¯t look so good. Partly this was because of thedirt and noise; the main city of Fuling was an unbelievably loud and pollutedplace. There wasn¡¯t as much heavy industry as in other parts of China, butthere were a few good-sized factories that spewed smoke and dust into theair. The power plant on the banks of the Wu River burned coal, as did all ofthe countless small restaurants that lined the city¡¯s streets, and automobileemissions were poorly regulated. In winter the air was particularly dirty, buteven in summer it was bad. If I went to town and blew my nose, the tissuewas streaked with black grease. This made me think about how the air wasaffecting my lungs, and for a while I wondered what could be done aboutthis. Finally I decided to stop looking at tissues after I blew my nose.

Noise was even more impressive. Most of it came from car horns, andit is difficult to explain how constant this sound was. I can start by saying:

Drivers in Fuling honked a lot. There weren¡¯t a great number of cars,but there were enough, and they were always passing each other in a madrush to get to wherever they were going. Most of them were cabs, and virtuallyevery cabby in Fuling had rewired his horn so it was triggered by acontact point at the tip of the gearshift. They did this for convenience; becauseof the hills, drivers shifted gears frequently, and with their hand onthe stick it was possible to touch the contact point ever so slightly and thehorn would sound. They honked at other cars, and they honked at pedestrians.

They honked whenever they passed somebody, or whenever they werebeing passed themselves. They honked when nobody was passing but somebodymight be considering it, or when the road was empty and there wasnobody to pass but the thought of passing or being passed had just passedthrough the driver¡¯s mind. Just like that, an unthinking reflex: the driverhonked. They did it so often that they didn¡¯t even feel the contact point beneaththeir fingers, and the other drivers and pedestrians were so familiarwith the sound that they essentially didn¡¯t hear it. Nobody reacted to hornsanymore; they served no purpose. A honk in Fuling was like the tree fallingin the forest¡ªfor all intents and purposes it was silent.

But at the beginning Adam and I heard it. For the first few weeks we oftencomplained about the honking and the noise, the same way we complainedabout blowing our noses and seeing the tissue turn black. But the simple truthwas that you could do nothing about either the noise or the pollution, whichmeant that they could either become very important and very annoying, orthey could become not important at all. For sanity¡¯s sake we took the secondoption, like the locals, and soon we learned to talk about other things.

I realized this in early November, when a college friend of mine namedScott Kramer came to visit. For five years he had lived in Manhattan, and yetthe noise in Fuling absolutely stunned him; he heard every horn, every shout,every blurted announcement from every loudspeaker. When he left, we tooka cab from the college to the docks, and Kramer, who worked on Wall Streetand had a mathematical turn of mind, counted the honks as our driver spedthrough the city. It was a fifteen-minute ride and the driver touched hiscontact point 566 times. It came to thirty-seven honks per minute.

If Kramer hadn¡¯t been counting, I wouldn¡¯t have noticed, and I realizedthat I had stopped hearing the horns long ago, just like everybody else intown. In fact, Kramer was the only person in the whole city who heardthem, which explained why he was so overwhelmed. The entire city hadbeen honking at him for a week.

For me it wasn¡¯t the same, and after a month or so the discomforts ofFuling weren¡¯t important enough to deter me from going into town. Despitethe noise and the pollution, it was still a fascinating place, and I still wantedto explore its corners and learn its secrets. But the language was an enormousproblem, and in the beginning it made the city frustrating and evenfrightening.

Mandarin Chinese has a reputation as a difficult language¡ªsome expertssay it takes four times as long to learn as Spanish or French¡ªand its charactersand tones are particularly challenging to a Westerner, because they arecompletely different from the way our languages are structured. In Sichuan,things are further complicated by the provincial dialect, which is distinctenough that a Chinese outsider has trouble understanding the locals in aplace like Fuling. The variations between Mandarin and Sichuanese are significant:

in addition to some differences in vocabulary, Sichuanese slurs theMandarin reflexive sounds¡ªsh becomes s, zh becomes z¡ªand certain consonantsare reversed, so that the average person in Sichuan confuses n andl, and h and f. A word like ¡°Hunan¡± becomes ¡°Fulan.¡± The Sichuanese tonalrange is also shorter, and most significant, two of the four Mandarin tonesare reversed in Sichuan. If Mandarin is your starting point, it seems that theentire language has been flattened and turned upside down.

In addition, Sichuan is an enormous province where lack of development,particularly with regard to road and rail links, has resulted in vast regionaldifferences. The Chengdu dialect is distinct from that of Chongqing, which isalso different from that of Leshan, and so on. The town of Fengdu is less thanthirty miles downstream from Fuling, and yet occasionally the residents ofthese places have difficulty understanding each other. At a Fuling restaurant,if you want the dish known as hundun in Mandarin¡ªtranslated in Englishas ¡°wonton¡±¡ªyou have to ask for chaoshou, but if you go another thirtymiles to Fengdu you¡¯ll have to call it baomian. Or, more accurately, baomin,because the folks in Fengdu slur the ian sounds.

The result is a hell of a mess that I hadn¡¯t expected. I came to China hopingto learn Chinese, but quickly I realized there was no such thing. ¡°Chinese¡±

was whatever it took to communicate with the person you happened to betalking with, and this changed dramatically depending on background andeducation level. Educated people usually could speak Mandarin, especiallyif they were from the younger generation¡ªthe walls of our classrooms hadenormous signs that commanded: ¡°Use Mandarin!¡± But the vast majorityof Fuling¡¯s population was uneducated and functioned only in the dialect.

It made going to town a frustrating experience, because even the simplestconversations were difficult, and it also made my goal of learning Chineseseem impossible: I couldn¡¯t imagine learning both Mandarin and Sichuanesein two years. In fact, all I needed to do was improve my Mandarin, whichwould naturally enable me to handle the dialect, but in the early months Ididn¡¯t know that. It seemed that I was in hopelessly over my head, and everytrip into town was a reminder of that failure.

And Fuling was a frightening place because the people had seen so fewoutsiders. If I ate at a restaurant or bought something from a store, a crowdwould quickly gather, often as many as thirty people spilling out into thestreet. Most of the attention was innocent curiosity, but it made the embarrassmentof my bad Chinese all the worse¡ªI¡¯d try to communicate withthe owner, and people would laugh and talk among themselves, and in mynervousness I would speak even worse Mandarin. When I walked down thestreet, people constantly turned and shouted at me. Often they screamedwaiguoren or laowai, both of which simply meant ¡°foreigner.¡± Again, thesephrases often weren¡¯t intentionally insulting, but intentions mattered less andless with every day that these words were screamed at me. Another favoritewas ¡°hello,¡± a meaningless, mocking version of the word that was strung outinto a long ¡°hah-loooo!¡± This word was so closely associated with foreignersthat sometimes the people used it instead of waiguoren¡ªthey¡¯d say, ¡°Look,here come two hellos!¡± And often in Fuling they shouted other less innocentterms¡ª yangguizi, or ¡°foreign devil¡± da bizi, ¡°big nose¡±¡ªalthough it wasn¡¯tuntil later that I understood what these phrases meant.

The stresses piled up every time I went into town: the confusion and embarrassmentof the language, the shouts and stares, the mocking calls. It waseven worse for Adam, who was tall and blond; at least I had the advantageof being dark-haired and only slightly bigger than the locals. For a whilewe adopted the strategy of going into town together, thinking that betweenthe two of us we could more easily handle the pressure. This was a mistake,though, because adding another waiguoren only increased the attention, andafter a month of that we started making our trips solo. Finally, as the fallsemester wore on, we did everything possible to avoid going to town. When Idid go, I wore headphones. That was the only way I could handle it; I listenedto the loudest and most offensive rap music I had¡ªDr. Dre, Snoop DoggyDogg, the Beastie Boys¡ªand it was just enough to drown out the shouts asI walked down the street. It made for surreal trips downtown, listening toSnoop rap obscenities while I dodged the crowds, but it kept me sane.

And so Soddy¡¯s question remained: How do you spend your spare time?

When I finished teaching I would sit at my desk, which looked out across theWu River to the city, and I would write:

While I wrote, I pronounced the word over and over, as carefully as Idrew it:

¡°Xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xuexue xue xue.¡±

I would write the same character about a hundred times total, and thenI would think of ways in which it was used: xuexi, xuesheng, xuexiao. Iwould write it on a flash card and put it on a stack that grew steadily on mydesk¡ªbetween five and ten a day, usually. I listened to language tapes andreviewed the text that we had used during Peace Corps training. I flippedthrough the flash cards. By early October, when Dean Fu finally found twoChinese tutors, I had learned 150 characters. The signs on the way to Raisethe Flag Mountain were still unintelligible, but the one in the center of campushad changed slightly:

Teaching People, People,People, Environment PeopleOUR TUTORS were Kong Ming and Liao Mei, and we came to know themas Teacher Kong and Teacher Liao. They taught in the Chinese department,and neither of them spoke any English. They had never known a waiguorenbefore. Dean Fu had been unable to find tutors who spoke English, and atlast we told him it wasn¡¯t important. We wanted to get started and we knewthat Chinese department teachers had good Mandarin.

Teacher Kong was a short man who wore glasses and smelled of MagnificentSound cigarettes. He was thirty-two years old, and he taught ancientChinese literature. By Chinese standards he was slightly fat, which meantthat by American standards he was slightly thin. He smiled easily. He wasfrom the countryside of Fengdu, which was famous for its ghosts¡ªlegendsaid that spirits went to Fengdu after death.

Teacher Liao was a very thin woman with long black hair and a reservedmanner. She was twenty-seven years old, and she taught modern Chinese.

She smiled less than Teacher Kong. Our students, who also had some coursesin the Chinese department, considered Teacher Liao to be one of their betterinstructors. She was from the central Sichuan city of Zigong, which wasfamous for its salt. Every city and small town in Sichuan claimed to be famousfor something. Fuling was famous for the hot pickled mustard tuber that wascured along the banks of the rivers.

That was essentially everything we knew about Teachers Kong and Liaofor months. We also knew about their Mandarin, which was very clear exceptfor a slight Sichuanese tendency to confuse the n and l sounds. Other thanthat we knew nothing. To us they were like Chinese-teaching machines,or perhaps farm animals¡ªa sort of inexpensive and bored draft horse thatcorrected bad tones. And to them we were very stupid waiguoren from acountry whose crude tongue had no tones at all.

My first tutorial with Teacher Liao was scheduled for two hours, but Ilasted less than sixty minutes. I went home with my head reeling¡ªhad a humanbeing ever compressed more wrongness into a single hour? Everythingwas wrong¡ªtones, grammar, vocabulary, initial sounds. She would ask mea question and I would try to process the language to respond, but before Icould speak she was answering it herself. She spoke clearly, of course, and itwas also true that during that hour not a word of English had been spoken.

That was what I wanted, after all¡ªa Chinese tutor. But I couldn¡¯t imaginedoing that for seven hours a week and maintaining my sanity, and I lookedat the pathetic stack of flash cards on my desk and thought: This is hopeless.

For a solid month it looked that way. I was too self-absorbed to evenimagine what it was like from the other side, but later I realized that itwas even worse for my teachers. They weren¡¯t under threat of executionfor teaching the sacred tones to a waiguoren¡ªthat law, at least, had beenchanged since Qing Dynasty days. But theirs wasn¡¯t an enviable job. Firstof all, we underpaid them. This wasn¡¯t intentional; Adam and I had beengiven wrong information about the standard rate for tutors. Teachers Kongand Liao, of course, were far too polite to set us straight, which meant thatfor the entire first year they worked for two-thirds of what they deserved.

Even worse, though, they were underpaid for seven weekly hours of boredomand frustration. The lessons in the book were simple¡ªtaking a train,going to a restaurant¡ªand yet I botched everything, and they had no ideahow to steer me in the right direction. How do you teach somebody to speakChinese? How do you take your knowledge of ancient poetry and use it tohelp a waiguoren master something as basic as the third tone?

We were all lost, and that failure seemed to be the extent of our relationship.

Other Peace Corps volunteers had tutors who spoke English, so at leastthey could chat together after class. They heard about their tutors¡¯ families;they ate dinner together; they became friends. My tutors didn¡¯t seem like realpeople¡ªit was months before I learned that Teacher Liao was married andthat Teacher Kong had a son. Here the language problem was compoundedby the fact that at the beginning they were somewhat cagey and distant; theyhad never known a waiguoren before, and they weren¡¯t at all certain how toapproach us.

Chinese teaching styles are also significantly different from western methods,which made my tutorials even more frustrating. In China, a teacher isabsolutely respected without question, and the teacher-student relationshiptends to be formal. The teacher teaches and is right, and the student studiesand is wrong. But this isn¡¯t our tradition in America, as my own studentsnoticed. I encouraged informality in our classes, and if a student was wrongI pointed out what she had done right and praised her for making a goodeffort. To them, this praise was meaningless. What was the point of that? Ifa student was wrong, she needed to be corrected without any quibbling orsoftening¡ªthat was the Chinese way.

I couldn¡¯t teach like that, and it was even harder to play the role of student.

Actually, this became worse after my Chinese classes started to feelproductive, which happened more quickly than I expected. The charactersin my book¡¯s lessons had always been elusive, odd-shaped scratches of blackthat drifted in and out of my head, calling up arbitrary allusions that weremisleading. They were pictures rather than words: I would look at andthink of K-mart, and the twenty-seventh radical--- reminded me of the letterB, or perhaps an ax hanging on a wall. looked like a man doing jumpingjacks. was a marching spider carrying a flag across the page. I stared solong at those odd figures that I dreamed about them¡ªthey swarmed in myhead and I awoke vaguely disturbed and missing home.

But at a certain point it was as if some of the scratchings stood up straightand looked me in the eye, and the fanciful associations started slipping away.

Suddenly they became words; they had meaning. Of course, it didn¡¯t happenall at once, and it was work that did it¡ªI was studying madly in an effort tomake the classes less miserable. But I was so busy that I hardly had time torealize that progress was being made.

One day after more than a month of classes, I read aloud a paragraphfrom my book, recognizing all of the characters smoothly except for one.

I sat back and started to register the achievement: I was actually readingChinese. The language was starting to make sense. But before this sense ofsatisfaction was half formed, Teacher Liao said, ¡°Budui!¡±

It meant, literally, ¡°Not correct.¡± You could also translate it as no, wrong,nope, uh-uh. Flatly and clearly incorrect. There were many Chinese wordsthat I didn¡¯t know, but I knew that one well.

A voice in my head whined: All of the rest of them were right; isn¡¯tthat worth something? But for Teacher Liao it didn¡¯t work like that. If onecharacter was wrong it was simply budui.

¡°What¡¯s this word?¡± I asked, pointing at the character I had missed.

¡°Zhe¡ªthe zhe in zhejiang.¡±

¡°Third tone?¡±

¡°Fourth tone.¡±

I breathed deeply and read the section again, and this time I did it perfectly.

That was a victory¡ªI turned to Teacher Liao and my eyes said (orat least I imagined them saying): How do you like me now? But TeacherLiao¡¯s eyes were glazed with boredom and she said, ¡°Read the next one.¡±

They were, after all, simple paragraphs. Any schoolchild could handle them.

It was the Chinese way. Success was expected and failure criticized andpromptly corrected. You were right or you were budui; there was no middleground. As I became bolder with the language I started experimenting withnew words and new structures, and this was good but it was also a risk. Iwould finish a series of sentences using vocabulary that I knew Teacher Liaodidn¡¯t expect me to know, and I would swear that I could see her flinch withunwilling admiration. And yet she would say, ¡°Budui!¡± and correct the partthat had been wrong.

I grew to hate budui: its sound mocked me. There was a harshness toit; the bu was a rising tone and the dui dropped abruptly, building like myconfidence and then collapsing all at once. And it bothered me all the morebecause I knew that Teacher Liao was only telling the truth: virtually everythingI did with the language was budui. I was an adult, and as an adult Ishould be able to accept criticism where it was needed. But that wasn¡¯t theAmerican way; I was accustomed to having my ego soothed; I wanted to bepraised for my effort. I didn¡¯t mind criticism as long as it was candy-coated. Iwas caught in the same trap that I had heard about from some of my Chinese-American friends, who as children went to school and became accustomed tothe American system of gentle correction, only to return home and hear theirChinese-minded parents say, simply, budui. That single B on the report cardmatters much more than the string of A¡¯s that surrounds it. Keep working;you haven¡¯t achieved anything yet.

And so I studied. I was frustrated but I was also stubborn; I was determinedto show Teacher Liao that I was dui. Virtually all of my sparetime went to studying Chinese, and the stack of flash cards on my desk grewrapidly. By the first week in November I knew three hundred characters. Ihad no clear idea what I was shooting for¡ªI had a vague goal of readinga newspaper, which would require between two and three thousand. Butmostly I knew that I needed more knowledge than I had, and I needed itquickly.

In the mornings I ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain, charginghard up the steps, my lungs burning high above the Yangtze. The effort wassatisfying¡ªit was challenging but uncomplicated, and at the finish I couldlook down on the city and see where I had gone. It was different from thework of learning Chinese, which had no clear endpoint and gave me morefrustration than satisfaction.

There was a skill to running, and in some ways it was the only skill Ihad in Fuling. Everybody else seemed to have found something that he orshe was good at: the owner of the dumpling restaurant made dumplings,the shoeshine women shined shoes, the stick-stick soldiers carried loads ontheir leathered shoulders. It was less clear what my purpose was¡ªI was ateacher, and that job was satisfying and clearly defined, but it disappearedonce I left campus. Most people in town only saw my failures, the inevitablemisunderstandings and botched conversations.

And they always watched carefully. The attention was so intense thatin public I often became clumsily self-conscious, which was exacerbated bymy suddenly becoming bigger than average. In America I was consideredsmall at five feet nine inches, but now for the first time in my life I stoodout in crowds. I bumped my head on bus doorways; I squeezed awkwardlybehind miniature restaurant tables. I was like Alice in Wonderland, eatingthe currant-seed cakes and finding her world turned upside down.

Mostly I longed to find something that I could do well. This was part ofwhy the simple routines of the city fascinated me; I could watch a stick-sticksoldier or a restaurant cook with incredible intensity simply because thesepeople were good at what they did. There was a touch of voyeurism in myattention, at least in the sense that I watched the people work with all ofthe voyeur¡¯s impotent envy. There were many days when I would have likednothing more than to have had a simple skill that I could do over and overagain, as long as I did it well.

Running was repetitive in this way, and it was also an escape. If I ran onthe roads, cars honked at me, people laughed and shouted, and sometimes ayoung man would try to impress his friends by chasing after me. But crowdscouldn¡¯t gather around, and none of the young men followed for long. I ranalone, and in a crowded country that sort of solitude was worth something.

There was nobody in the city who could catch me.

Usually I ran in the hills behind campus, following the small roads andfootpaths that wound around Raise the Flag Mountain. I ran past old Daoistshrines, and atop the narrow walls of the rice paddies, and I followed thestone steps that led to the mountain¡¯s summit. I liked running past the ancientstone tombs that overlooked the rivers, and I liked seeing the peasantsat work. On my runs I watched them harvest the rice crop, and thresh theyellowed stalks, and I saw them plant the winter wheat and tend their vegetables.

I first learned the agricultural patterns by watching the workers as Iran, and I studied the shape of the mountain by feeling it beneath my legs.

The peasants found it strange that I ran in the hills, and they alwaysstared when I charged past, but they never shouted or laughed. As a rulethey were the most polite people you could ever hope to meet, and in anycase they had more important things to do with their energy than scream atwaiguoren. And perhaps they had an innate respect for physical effort, evenwhen they didn¡¯t see the point.

The air in the countryside was often bad, because the Yangtze windsblew the city¡¯s pollution across the Wu River, and I knew that running didmy health more harm than good. But it kept my mind steady, because thefields were quiet and peaceful and the activity felt the same as it alwayshad. That old well-known feeling¡ªthe catch in my chest, the strain in mylegs¡ªconnected all the places where I had lived, Missouri and Princeton andOxford and Fuling. While I ran through the hills, my thoughts swung fluidlybetween these times and places; I remembered running along the oldMissouri-Kansas-Texas railroad pathway, and I recalled the rapeseed bloominggold on Boar¡¯s Hill, and the old shaded bridge of Prettybrook. As themonths slipped past I realized that even these Sichuan hills, with their strangetombs and terraces, were starting to feel like home.

But still the signs on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain were foreign,and even as they slowly became familiar they reminded me how far I stillhad to go:

Build Culture, New Give BirthPopulation Increase, SocietyEducation Is a Powerful Country¡¯sDURING THAT SEMESTER there was a volatility to the written language;it constantly shifted in my eyes, and each day the shapes became somethingother than what they had been before. Spoken Chinese was also starting tosettle in my ears, and soon I could make simple conversation with the ownersof the restaurants where I ate. The same slow shift was also happening withregard to my tutors, who finally started to change from tone machines intoreal people.

As this happened, I began to sense an edge to Teacher Liao that I couldn¡¯tquite figure. It wasn¡¯t simply her tendency to say budui; she seemed slightlyuncomfortable around both Adam and me, and there were moments when Ialmost thought she disliked us (which, given that we didn¡¯t pay her enough,would have been understandable). Later, I would come to recognize otherreasons for this discomfort, but during that first semester I only sensed thatthere were complications in our relationship.

Once we had a tutorial the day after I had played in the faculty basketballtournament, and she asked what I had thought of the game. In fact, it hadgone very badly¡ªAdam and I were starting to realize that there was a greatdeal of resentment over our participation, because the English departmentteam was now suddenly very good. To the other participants, the games weretaking on a patriotic significance; it was a matter of China vs. America, anissue of saving face for the Motherland, and the games grew steadily rougherand rougher. The referees also took sides; they allowed our opponents tofoul us while constantly whistling us for phantom violations. In the gamebefore our tutorial, I had been whistled more than fifteen times for doubledribble¡ªby the end of the game I only had to touch the ball and the whistlewould blow. Adam and I were considering pulling out of the tournament,which we eventually did. It seemed the best solution for everybody involved.

I knew that Teacher Liao had been at the game, and I assumed that shefelt the same way I did. My students had been embarrassed by the poorsportsmanship, and they told me that the referee had a horrible reputation oncampus. He was notorious for getting into fights¡ªonce he even threatenedan administrator with a knife. His wife had recently divorced him; the rumorwas that he had beaten her. And yet the college was unable to fire him,because of the job security that was promised to all state workers under thetraditional Communist system.

I answered Teacher Liao¡¯s question honestly, telling her that I hadn¡¯tfound the game much fun.

¡°That referee,¡± I said, ¡°is a huai dan.¡± It was a common insult: bad egg.

¡°Budui!¡± said Teacher Liao. ¡°It wasn¡¯t his problem¡ªyou were wrong.

And you should not criticize the referee.¡±

To me this seemed insult upon injury. I wanted to tell her: There are notones in basketball and you have no jurisdiction over it. But she had moreto say.

¡°You were dribbling wrong,¡± she said. ¡°That¡¯s why he kept penalizingyou. You were doing this¡ª¡± And she gestured, showing me that I had carriedthe ball.

¡°Budui!¡± I said. ¡°That¡¯s not what I was doing. I was dribbling the sameway I always do in America. That referee just doesn¡¯t like waiguoren. Andhe doesn¡¯t understand basketball.¡±

¡°Budui! Here you can¡¯t dribble the same way that you do in America,because they have different rules in the NBA. That¡¯s the problem¡ªyou¡¯reaccustomed to playing the American way.¡±

She said it in hopes of ending the argument tactfully, because she sawthat I was annoyed. But I had already heard too many explanations about¡°the Chinese way,¡± and I did not want to be lectured about Basketball withChinese Characteristics.

¡°Basketball is an American sport,¡± I said. ¡°We made the rules and I understandthem. That referee just doesn¡¯t like waiguoren.¡± After I spoke, Irealized how stupid my words sounded, and I might as well have continued:

And we Americans can study a language for only four months and alreadyconvey our arrogance. But I didn¡¯t have the vocabulary for that, and in anycase it was clear that both of us wanted to talk about something else. We revieweda lesson about going to the airport and nobody mentioned basketballagain.

Classes were simpler with Teacher Kong, who alternated weeks with TeacherLiao. He was slightly less inclined to say budui, partly because he had a lazystreak, but also because the struggles of that semester were slowly teachingus to recognize each other as people. Eventually he would become my firstreal Chinese friend¡ªthe first friend who saw me strictly in Chinese. Andeven in those early months, before we developed a true friendship, I couldsee his interest growing. He sometimes asked me about America, within thelimits of my vocabulary, and I sensed there were many questions he wouldask once he had the chance. Certainly I had a few of my own that werewaiting for the language to catch up with my thoughts.

We had classes in my dining room, where the morning light was warmafter the sun rose above the shoulder of Raise the Flag Mountain. We dranktea while we studied¡ªjasmine flower tea, the tiny dried petals unfolding likeblooming lilies on the surface of the hot water. Before he drank, TeacherKong blew softly over the cup, so the loose leaves and flowers floated to thefar side, and this was something else I learned in those classes. If he sipped aleaf by mistake, he turned and spat lightly on the floor. I learned that, too¡ªIliked living in a cadre¡¯s apartment and still being able to spit on the floor.

One sunny afternoon in December, I was preparing for class when I heardloud music blaring from the plaza below. There wasn¡¯t anything unusualabout that¡ªthe campus loudspeakers were always vomiting noise. But todayI looked down from my balcony and saw a crowd assembling in front of theauditorium, and I knew that some sort of important event was about to takeplace.

My balcony looked straight down to the plaza and I could see everythingclearly. A banner had been unfurled and stretched above the steps. I couldn¡¯tmake out most of the characters, but a few were recognizable: ¡°Safety,¡±

¡°Environment,¡± ¡°Peace.¡± A row of chairs materialized below the banner. Thecrowd grew larger. Tables were set in front of the chairs. A blue cloth waslaid upon the tables; teacups were put on the cloth. Microphones appeared.

I had seen this sort of arrangement before¡ªit was a nesting area forcadres. Soon six of them marched up the steps and took their places at thetable. I strained to see who they were, but I couldn¡¯t recognize their faces,and all I saw was that some were in uniform. But many people in Fulingwore uniforms and that never told you anything.

The speeches began, echoing up to my balcony. A crowd gathered at thebottom of the auditorium steps¡ªmostly students, but also people from theneighborhood outside the gates, old peasants and women with their babies.

They listened quietly, and in their silence I could see that it was a seriousevent. The speeches reverberated in the plaza and I couldn¡¯t understand whatthey were saying.

Teacher Kong arrived for class and set his books on the dining-room table.

¡°It¡¯s very loud,¡± he said, smiling, and I agreed¡ªtoo loud to concentrate onLesson Thirty-one and its mindless description of a train ride to Guilin. Westepped out onto the balcony and watched the crowd. There were hundredsof people listening to the speeches now, and I could see groups of studentshurrying down from the teaching building.

¡°All of the students have been excused from class,¡± Teacher Kong said,and I asked him what the event was. ¡°They¡¯re going to panjue two people,¡±

he said. ¡°It¡¯s a public panjue.¡±

I hadn¡¯t studied the word, and he explained its meaning until I was nearlycertain I understood. I went into the dining room to double-check with thedictionary¡ª¡°panjue: bring a verdict; judgment.¡± They were having a publicsentencing in front of the auditorium.

¡°Are they students?¡± I asked.

¡°No. They¡¯re from East River.¡±

I asked what they had done, and he explained that there had been a seriesof fights between East River people and students in the physical educationdepartment. East River was a rough part of town, a seedy riverfront sectionof small shops and dusty warehouses. After the Three Gorges Dam wasbuilt, much of East River would disappear underwater, and few people wouldprobably miss it. The dirty streets were depressing, and the residents, mostof whom were poor, saw the students as privileged outsiders¡ªspoiled kidswho lived six or seven to a bare room, cleaned their unheated classrooms, andwoke up at six o¡¯clock every morning for mandatory exercises. Sichuanesetown-and-gown tension was, like anything else, a matter of relative conditions.

Recently this animosity had turned ugly; some of the East River men hadused knives and sticks in the fights, and a couple of students had been hurt.

I heard about it from my own students, who wrote in their journals about aweekend night when two physical education boys had been injured and theirfriends returned to the dormitory for reinforcements. They were collectingweapons of their own when the police arrived.

¡°None of the injuries was too serious,¡± said Teacher Kong. ¡°But they wantto show the students that the college is safe, so today they¡¯re having a publicpanjue.¡±

The cadres finished their speeches, the crowd waiting in expectant silence.

Two men appeared, flanked by policemen. They wore cheap suitsand their hands were cuffed behind their backs. The police marched themhalfway down the steps of the auditorium, where they stood between thecadres and the crowd. The two men¡¯s heads were bowed. The students hadpressed to the front; at the back stood the peasants and the mothers withtheir babies. Everybody was quiet. In the background, from the Wu River, Iheard the low growl of riverboat horns.

One of the cadres read from a sheet of paper. His voice echoed over theplaza, and in response the crowd shifted and murmured. The two men kepttheir heads down.

¡°A few days,¡± Teacher Kong said. ¡°Only a few days in jail. Not veryserious.¡±

And in that instant it was over: the cops took the handcuffed men outthe front gate, where a bus was waiting; the cadres disappeared; the tableswere whisked away; the banner was taken down; the students returned toclass. The people in Fuling were extremely organized with public events andtheir rallies could materialize and disappear in the space of an hour. Withinfifteen minutes there was no sign that anything had happened in the plaza.

Teacher Kong and I reviewed some vocabulary from the trial, and thenwe moved on to Lesson Thirty-one. There was something strange about returningso quickly to class after having watched the sentencing from highabove, as from a luxury box at a stadium, turning somebody¡¯s public humiliationinto a vocabulary lesson. But many things were public in Fuling andfew locals would have found it unusual. I had Peace Corps friends at anotherSichuan teachers college who, the following spring, had their classes canceledone afternoon for a pre-execution rally in the school¡¯s sports stadium.

Student attendance at the event was mandatory, because the criminals wereyoung drug dealers and their deaths would provide a valuable lesson for thespectators. The college gathered in the stadium, where the police paradedthe condemned prisoners in front of the students. Afterward the criminalswere taken away to the countryside and shot. Classes resumed as normal thenext day.

NOT LONG AFTER the sentencing, I came back from a run and realizedthat the sign in the center of campus had become completely intelligible.

This was a moment I had always looked forward to¡ªfrom the beginning, Ihad seen that string of characters as a benchmark, and I traced my progressin the way those words became meaningful. And one day all of it finallymade sense:

Teaching Educates the People, Administration Educates the People,Service Educates the People, Environment Educates the PeopleI stopped and took a long look. I read the sign again, waiting for thesense of achievement. But nothing was there¡ªit was simply propaganda,the same sort of trite phrase that could be found in the students¡¯ textbooks oron billboards all across the city. I would react the same way when the othermessages on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain came into focus:

Construct a Spiritual Civilization, Replace the Old Concept ofGiving BirthControlling Population Growth Promotes Social DevelopmentEducation Is the Foundation upon Which a Powerful Nation Is BuiltAll of it was the same old cant. Every time one of the signs becameintelligible, I felt very little of the satisfaction that I had once imagined.

Instead I heard Teacher Liao¡¯s voice in my head: Read the next one. Youhaven¡¯t achieved anything yet. And so I kept writing the characters over andover again at my desk, gazing out my window at the city.

LATE ONE AFTERNOON in December, Adam and I were summoned tothe English department office, where we were informed that there wouldbe a banquet tonight. These announcements were always made at the lastminute, and they meant that the evening was effectively finished, because itwas impossible to go to a banquet and not get hopelessly drunk.

A good part of our Peace Corps medical training had involved preparationfor these moments. Even though we were only the third Peace Corps Chinagroup, the Sichuan countryside was already littered with tales of volunteerswho had become banquet casualties. There were stories of fights, of vandalism,of volunteers who had become so dangerously intoxicated that they foreverswore off drinking at such occasions. Our medical officer strongly recommendedthat after arriving at site we establish ourselves as nondrinkers,at least as far as banquets were concerned.

The most frequently performed procedure in Sichuanese emergency roomswas stomach-pumping. The vast majority of these patients were male, becausedrinking, like smoking, was an important part of being a man. Thiswas true in many parts of China, especially in the more remote regions, andSichuan drinking wasn¡¯t simply a casual way to relax. Often it was competitive,and usually it involved baijiu, a powerful and foul-tasting grain alcohol.

Men toasted each other with full shots, and there was a tendency for thisdrinking to turn into a kind of bullying, the participants goading each otheruntil somebody got sick. One of our Peace Corps training sessions had involvedpersonal testimony from a Sichuanese man, who shrugged sheepishlyand explained that even good friends were perfectly willing to drink eachother into the hospital. Like the medical officer, he recommended that weuse our waiguoren status to avoid this ritual entirely.

It was a typical Peace Corps scenario: having been told a wealth of horrorstories about the pointless machismo of Sichuanese drinking, Adam and Iwere promptly sent down the river to the most remote Peace Corps site inthe province. At our welcoming banquet, when we were served our firstshot of baijiu, neither of us hesitated for even a second. Our training hadrepeatedly emphasized that this was critical to whatever it took to be a manin a place like Fuling, and as far as we were concerned this was part of ourjob. We hadn¡¯t come all this way just to be waiguoren. We downed the shot,and we downed the next one, too.

During that first month we had two or three banquets a week, and soonI could see that all of the drinking was organized with remarkable intricacyThe faculty took it easy on us at the beginning, no doubt because the PeaceCorps had given all the colleges a stern warning about responsibility. Buteventually our colleagues came to the same conclusion that we had: thePeace Corps was far away. Steadily the pressure to drink increased, and astime passed I realized that the English department had an alcoholic leaderboard.

This wasn¡¯t a literal leaderboard in the sense of being written down,but it was completely public and accepted. You could ask any teacher wherehis alcohol tolerance stood in relation to everybody else¡¯s in the department,and he would answer with well-tested precision. Party Secretary Zhang wasat the top, followed by Albert, then Dean Fu, and so on through the ranks untilyou came to Teacher Sai, who was such a lightweight that people referredto him scornfully as ¡°Miss Sai¡± during banquets.

Within three weeks Adam was the undisputed number one drinker in theEnglish department. I was ranked second; Party Secretary Zhang slipped tothird. In truth I wasn¡¯t much of a drinker at home, but Fuling tolerance levelstended to be low, because many residents have a genetic intolerance of alcoholthat is common among Asians. Even Party Secretary Zhang, despite hislofty ranking, turned bright red after a few drinks. This was one reason whylocal drinking patterns were so abusive with relatively light consequences;most people were genetically unable to become alcoholics. Once or twice aweek they might be able to drink heavily, but they got too sick to do it allthe time. It was a ritual rather than a habit.

In a pathetic way, drinking became one small thing that Adam and I weregood at, although it was difficult to take much pride in this. If anything, itsaid a great deal about our troubles adjusting to Fuling life, because the banquetsand the drinking, despite their strange childishness, represented one ofour more comfortable environments. We gained instant respect for our tolerancelevels, and to a certain degree this was how the department authoritiescommunicated with us. If they had something important to tell us, or if a requestneeded to be made, it was handled at a banquet. Our colleagues, whousually seemed stiff and nervous around the waiguoren, loosened up once thebaijiu started flowing. These events were strictly all-male¡ªthe only womeninvolved were the waitresses who served the baijiu.

Before the December banquet, Adam and I were escorted into the Englishdepartment office to meet our hosts for the evening. Two men stood upand shook our hands, smiling. One of them was a tall handsome man in hisforties and the other was a short older man of perhaps sixty years. The tallman wore a new sweater, and from the way he carried himself it was clearthat he was important¡ªa cadre. It was also just as obvious that they werehere to make some request of us, because they were sponsoring the meal.

Teacher Sai and Dean Fu were there to translate.

¡°This is Mr. Wang from the Chinese department,¡± Teacher Sai said. ¡°Mr.

Wang came to the college in 1977¡ªhe was part of the first class when thecollege opened after the Great Cultural Revolution. He was the best Englishstudent, but English was not a preferred subject in those days. So he becamea Chinese professor instead. But he is still very interested in English.¡±

Adam and I shook Teacher Wang¡¯s hand again. Teacher Sai seemed tohave forgotten the other man, who didn¡¯t appear to be offended. Obviouslyhe was accustomed to moving in the bigger man¡¯s wake.

All of us sat down. Adam and I waited for the request; cynically I assumedthat Teacher Wang wanted English lessons. Already I could imagine myselfsitting in this cadre¡¯s office, bored to tears while he said, slowly, ¡°How-areyou?¡±

¡°Mr. Wang has heard that you studied literature,¡± Dean Fu said. ¡°Hewants to ask you some questions about American literature.¡±

This took me by surprise. I asked him what he meant.

¡°Mr. Wang is the editor of the college literary magazine,¡± said Dean Fu.

¡°He has more than ten thousand books.¡±

He paused to let the number sink in. Then he leaned forward and spokein a low voice. ¡°Mr. Wang,¡± he said, ¡°has the most books of anybody inFuling Teachers College.¡±

A proud smile flickered across Teacher Wang¡¯s face and I could see thathe understood what had been said. I wondered if Sichuanese men had bookrankings as well as alcohol rankings, and what the relationship might bebetween these two sources of prestige. This was all uncharted territory¡ªinPeace Corps training nobody had warned us about books.

I said that I knew less about American literature than English literature,but I¡¯d try to answer his questions. Teacher Wang nodded and shot off hisfirst query in Chinese to Dean Fu, who translated.

¡°Mr. Wang has a question about Saul Bellow,¡± he announced. ¡°Does theaverage American understand his books?¡±

I said that I had read very little of Bellow¡¯s work, but my impression wasthat his style was accessible, and that he was considered one of the bestJewish American writers and a voice of Chicago. Teacher Wang nodded, asif this was what he had expected to hear. He had another question ready.

¡°What about Joyce Carol Oates?¡± Dean Fu said. ¡°Do you think that shefollows in the tradition of Virginia Woolf?¡±

¡°Not really,¡± I said. ¡°Most people say that Joyce Carol Oates isn¡¯t a feministwriter. Actually, some feminists criticize her.¡±

This led us to a discussion on feminism, followed by Toni Morrison andblack women writers, and then we came to southern literature. After that wetalked about Hemingway and the ¡°Dirty Realism¡± of authors like RaymondCarver and Tobias Wolff. All of it was translated through Dean Fu, and as wetalked I realized that he had an even more impressive knowledge of Americanliterature than I had thought. I also realized that I was a jackass for assumingthat the ten-thousand-book Teacher Wang needed my help to say ¡°How-areyou.¡±

After half an hour we moved to the banquet hall. The first toast was ageneral one, for everybody at the table, and then Teacher Wang gave Adamand me a special toast. Party Secretary Zhang followed with another shot forthe entire party. When the next toast came around, Teacher Sai pushed hiscup away and grinned nervously.

¡°I can¡¯t drink any more,¡± he said. ¡°That is enough.¡±

¡°Drink it,¡± said Party Secretary Zhang. ¡°All of it.¡±

¡°You know that I do not drink,¡± Teacher Sai said. He brought his handstogether and bowed his head quickly in a pleading gesture. Teacher Sai wasone of the brightest of the department teachers, a pudgy man in his fortieswho was always smiling. Tonight his face was already bright red after twoshots. He shook his head again.

¡°No, no, no,¡± said Party Secretary Zhang. ¡°You must do it for our guests.¡±

¡°I can¡¯t.¡±

They were speaking English for our benefit, but then they shifted to Chinese.

While arguing they fought over the cup¡ªTeacher Sai tried to push itaway while Party Secretary Zhang held it firmly on the table. Dean Fu andTeacher Wang grinned. They joined in, scoffing at Teacher Sai until at lasthe picked up the shot glass. Everybody watched.

It took him a long time to drain the cup. He drank it in three painful sips,and after the last one he gasped and coughed. He put the cup back downon the table. Within seconds the waitress was there to refill it. Teacher Saiquickly put his hand over the cup, shaking his head.

¡°That is enough,¡± he said.

Party Secretary Zhang tried to pry Teacher Sai¡¯s hand away. The waitressstood by patiently, bottle in hand. It was a quintessentially Sichuanesescene¡ªfor every scroll painting of a lovely river they could have had tendepicting baijiu arguments, two men scrabbling over a cup while a youngwoman waited with a bottle.

¡°Seriously,¡± Teacher Sai said. ¡°That is enough for me.¡±

¡°Miss Sai,¡± taunted Party Secretary Zhang, pulling at his hand.

¡°Miss Sai,¡± echoed Dean Fu, grinning.

Teacher Wang said something and everybody laughed. For a few minutesthe entire table was focused on Teacher Sai¡¯s cup. It was hard to believe thatless than an hour ago we had been talking about Saul Bellow and Joyce CarolOates. Finally Teacher Sai relented.

¡°Only one more,¡± he said. ¡°This is the last one.¡±

The waitress filled his cup. Teacher Wang smiled and turned his attentiontoward Adam and me. He made a quick gesture, holding up his cup, and thethree of us drank. Teacher Wang downed the baijiu easily and he was notturning red.

The food came and for a while the shots slowed. When they resumed,everybody had forgotten about Teacher Sai, who was only good entertainmentat the start and finish of a banquet. He was too much hassle once theserious drinking started and now he sat sipping tea while the baijiu flowedin earnest.

There was strategy to this part of the banquet and usually the shotswere preceded by low murmurings, the teachers speaking the Sichuan dialectwhile Adam and I muttered English back and forth. The trick was toget a two-for-one¡ªif Party Secretary Zhang toasted both Adam and me, thenwe would both drink and immediately afterward Dean Fu could do the same.

Our response was to hit them with a preemptive strike; if we sensed that theywere plotting, one of us would toast the pair, or the entire table, and thenthey would have to recover before resuming the attack. Occasionally theytried to focus on me, sensing weakness, but when that happened Adam wouldstep in and cover me. That was acceptable in Sichuan¡ªa friend could takea shot for you. Sichuanese drinking was a lot like war.

Every banquet had a leader, a sort of alcoholic alpha male who controlledthe direction of the baijiu. Party Secretary Zhang always led the Englishdepartmentevents, but tonight he deferred to Teacher Wang. The big manworked quickly and with surprising fairness, toasting the entire table untilthe other teachers started to weaken. After that he focused on Adam and me,scorning the usual two-for-one as he traded personal shots between the twoof us. It was a remarkable exhibition. After half an hour the three of us werestill the most sober at the table, but I was fading quickly and Teacher Wangshowed no signs of slowing. I heard Dean Fu and Party Secretary Zhangasking him to ease up, because they were afraid I would get sick, and at lastthe flurry of toasts ended.

Teacher Wang began to tell a long story. It was about a pedicab and hetold it in Sichuanese while Teacher Sai translated. The story moved slowlyand I was too drunk to listen carefully. My gaze wandered across the tableuntil I found myself looking at the little man who had come with TeacherWang. I had forgotten entirely about him and now he smiled. He said something,but I couldn¡¯t understand; he was a dialect speaker and in any casethe baijiu had not improved either of our language abilities. Finally he concentratedvery hard, pronouncing four Mandarin syllables clearly.

¡°Sha shi bi ya,¡± he said.

¡°I¡¯m sorry,¡± I said in Chinese. ¡°What did you say?¡±

¡°Sha shi bi ya.¡±

I shook my head and he repeated it a few more times, gesturing as if hewere reading a book. Finally something clicked in my mind.

¡°Shakespeare?¡± I said.

He laughed and gave me the thumbs up. ¡°Di gen si.¡±

¡°Dickens?¡±

He nodded and laughed again.

¡°Ma ke tu wen.¡±

¡°Mark Twain.¡±

Slowly we made our way through Melville, Norris, O¡¯Connor, and Cheever.

It took me a long time to guess Norris and Cheever. There wasn¡¯t anythingelse that we were able to talk about and I never learned the little man¡¯s name,although he was able to communicate that he especially liked the Norrisnovel McTeague, which is perhaps the only great American novel about adentist. Nowadays hardly anybody in America reads Norris but there was atleast one fan along the Upper Yangtze.

Teacher Wang finished with the pedicab story. Even though I had missedmost of it I could gather that it was about a time when he was very drunkand spent half an hour negotiating with a pedicab, only to realize that he wasalready in front of his hotel. All of the men laughed at the story. Listeningto its translation reminded them that Teacher Sai was still there.

¡°Drink,¡± said Party Secretary Zhang, pointing at Teacher Sai¡¯s cup.

¡°I can¡¯t.¡±

¡°Drink.¡±

¡°I can¡¯t.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Drink.¡±

¡°I¡¯m sorry.¡±

¡°Miss Sai!¡±

¡°Miss Sai!¡±

Finally he shuddered through another shot. It was clear that the banquetwas breaking up, and Teacher Wang held his cup up to Adam and me. Weraised our glasses.

¡°To books,¡± I said.

But Teacher Wang had something else in mind. He spoke to me, seriouslynow, and Teacher Sai translated.

¡°Mr. Wang,¡± he said, ¡°wants you to write something for the college magazine.¡±

Our cups were frozen above the table.

¡°What do you mean?¡±

¡°He wants you to write an article about literature.¡±

¡°American or English? And how long?¡±

They discussed this quickly. Our three cups were still in midair; it waswithout question the most favorable instant for a request.

¡°American is better,¡± said Teacher Sai. ¡°Only about ten thousand words.¡±

I caught my breath. ¡°I don¡¯t know American literature well enough forthat,¡± I said. ¡°Tell him I can do either Elizabethan poetry or Charles Dickens,because that¡¯s what I studied at Oxford. Or Shakespeare. But otherwise itwould be difficult. I don¡¯t have many notes here.¡±

There was another discussion. My arm was growing heavy. TeacherWang nodded.

¡°Dickens,¡± said Teacher Sai. ¡°Ten thousand words.¡±

We drank the shot. The baijiu was starting to taste dangerously foul andI shuddered after it was down. A good banquet was like a good short story:

there was always a point, but you didn¡¯t quite understand it until the veryend. Now I realized why we had been invited tonight, but I wasn¡¯t resentful;at least now I knew how a Sichuanese literary journal recruited new material.

The table bullied Teacher Sai for a few more minutes and then all of usstaggered out.

I HOPED THAT EVERYBODY would forget about the promised essay, butwithin a week the quiet reminders started. I delayed, explaining that I wasbusy with teaching, but then I began to receive messages about TeacherWang¡¯s impending deadline. Finally I sat down and wrote what he wanted,which was an essay about Dickens¡¯ relationship to political reform.

I wrote it as quickly as possible. I argued that Dickens was essentiallya middle-class figure who liked writing about social problems not becausehe wanted revolutionary change, but rather because these subjects made forgood creative material. I knew the Marxists wouldn¡¯t like this approach, so Iadded a line that accused Dickens of being a Capitalist Roader. I liked beingable to use that term in a literary essay. Otherwise the article was not veryenjoyable to write, and I loaded the descriptions in order to jack up the wordcount. Teacher Sai had to translate it into Chinese. For a solid week hestruggled with the damn thing, coming into my office with questions aboutmy inflated prose, holding his head in his hands.

ON THE SECOND DAY of January, the city of Fuling held a road race inthe center of town. It was the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to WelcomeSpring, and all of the city¡¯s schools and danwei, or work units, competedagainst each other. Two weeks before the race, Dean Fu asked if I would runon the college team. He was obviously nervous, because it hadn¡¯t been longsince the problems of the faculty basketball tournament.

¡°You must understand,¡± he said, smiling uncomfortably. ¡°There will bemany peasants and uneducated people. They don¡¯t know anything aboutsportsmanship, and perhaps some of them will be rough. Also, in twentyoneyears they have never had a foreigner in the long race. They welcomeyou to participate, but I think it will be different from in America.¡±

I could see that Dean Fu thought it would be simpler if I didn¡¯t run, andI knew he was right. For a while I considered not taking part, because thebasketball tournament had been a low point in an otherwise good semester.

All of the difficult parts of my life were already public; there wasn¡¯t anyreason to seek out more crowds.

But there are no referees in running, and it is not a contact sport. Therewould be crowds but I figured that at least I would be moving. It couldn¡¯t bemuch different from a race in America¡ªand even if it was, I was curious tosee what it was like, at least once. I told Dean Fu that I wanted to participate.

He explained that every runner had to have a physical exam, and a weekbefore the race I visited a doctor in the college infirmary. It was a low tileroofedbuilding next to the croquet court, one of the old structures on campusthat remained from the pre-Cultural Revolution days when the college hadbeen a high school.

The doctor checked my pulse and blood pressure. After each test hesmiled and told me that I was very healthy, and I thanked him. Then heled me to a side room where a dirty white box-shaped instrument hung onthe wall. Dean Fu said, ¡°Now you will have a chest X ray.¡±

I stopped at the entrance to the room. ¡°I don¡¯t want to have a chest Xray,¡± I said.

¡°It¡¯s no problem,¡± said Dean Fu, smiling. ¡°It¡¯s very safe.¡±

¡°I don¡¯t want a chest X ray,¡± I said again, and I looked at the dirty boxand thought: Especially I don¡¯t want this chest X ray. ¡°Why is it necessary?¡±

¡°Everybody in the race must have one. To make sure they are healthy.¡±

¡°Everybody?¡± I asked, and he nodded. I asked how many people wouldbe running.

¡°More than two thousand and five hundred.¡±

¡°And all of them must have a chest X ray before they can run?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± he said. ¡°That is the rule. It is very safe.¡±

It struck me as a ludicrous notion¡ªthat a city with a per capita income ofabout forty American dollars a month would require a chest X ray from eachof the 2,500 participants in a four-kilometer road race. I had my suspicionsabout what was really happening: some administrator in the college wasprobably worried about me dropping dead in the middle of the race, andthey wanted to cover their tracks. It was always Dean Fu¡¯s job to conveysuch commands to the waiguoren, and occasionally he served as a filter asmuch as a translator. It was a lousy job and I always felt sorry for him whenI sensed that this was happening, but there was nothing to do about it excepttry to find a tactful solution.

We were at an impasse. Dean Fu could see that I was serious about refusingto have an X ray, and I knew that he couldn¡¯t simply back down and saythat the procedure wasn¡¯t in fact required. We stood there for a moment, thedoctor watching expectantly. Finally I told Dean Fu that I would go to myapartment and call the Peace Corps office in Chengdu.

I tried to call but the medical officer wasn¡¯t in. I sat in my bedroom forten minutes, reading a book, and then I returned to the infirmary.

¡°I¡¯m very sorry,¡± I said, ¡°but the Peace Corps told me I can¡¯t have a chestX ray. I don¡¯t know what we can do about this.¡±

¡°It¡¯s no problem,¡± Dean Fu said. ¡°I just talked to some of the people incharge of the race, and they said it is fine if you do not have an X ray. Theywill give you an exception because you are a foreigner.¡±

I thanked him and apologized for the hassle, and he apologized back.

Both of us shook the doctor¡¯s hand. He walked us to the door, smiling andwaving as we left.

THERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TIME for the race to start. The runnersassembled in a disorderly mob at the starting area, and at nine o¡¯clock thecadres began their speeches. The race would begin whenever the speechesfinished, and the officials droned on and on while the starting line repeatedlybroke and surged. A small section would make a false start and the rest ofthe crowd would react, and then the police would call everybody back. Itried to jog in place to stay warm, fighting with my elbows to keep position.

The starting line was spread across a massive construction site where anew public park was being built. The entire left side of the line headeddirectly toward a six-foot drop¡ªa small, crumbling cliff. On the far rightwas a narrow dirt road that provided the only safe exit for the runners, but itwas so close to the start¡ªless than forty yards¡ªthat it would be impossiblefor the crowd to funnel in such a short distance. And even for the runnerswho did make it safely, the course immediately took a ninety-degree turnthat would claim more victims.

Without question it was the most dangerous starting arrangement I hadever seen in a lifetime of racing. I was tempted to pull out, partly for mysafety but mostly because I wanted to be able to watch the disaster fromthe perspective of a spectator. Rob Schmitz, another Peace Corps volunteer,was visiting us that week, and he and Adam took their cameras and gleefullywaited across the road.

The college team had staked out a spot on the right side of the line, directlyin front of the exit. Most of them were physical education students,and usually we were the best team in the race, along with the Taiji medicinefactory. All of us squeezed together, waiting for the start. It was a coolmorning and the winter smog hung low over the city.

Five minutes passed, then ten. The cadres kept talking, and the policewere having trouble holding everybody back. Either they were going to startthe race or it was going to start itself, and finally one of the cadres must haverealized this. He fired the gun.

It was China. Chaos, noise, adrenaline; fear and surprise and excitement;a mass of bodies, everybody yelling, horns sounding, the earth pounding; allof us running madly, arms outstretched to clear room; legs pumping, dashing,sprinting, trying to keep the back kick low to avoid being tripped; somerunners shouting as they stumbled over the cliff, others skidding around thefirst turn, dodging the few unfortunate ones who fell and skidded below therush of legs. The seconds slid past, each moment an eternity of concentrationand effort. We flew down the street in a wild charging mob, hit the secondturn, and headed west on Xinghua Road.

The course began to climb uphill. The scene was still shaky with adrenalinebut I realized that the eternity of the start was over, and that I was no longera part of the starting mob. After the beginning of a race there is always thatmoment of disengagement, when the euphoria of being a part of somethingmassive is over and you realize that you are alone, and that you have yourown race to run.

I slowed down. Suddenly I felt tired; the adrenaline evaporated and everythingslipped into focus. I checked myself¡ªno scrapes, no bruises; nomemory of exactly how I had made it safely off the line. I glanced aroundme. I was in the lead pack, a group of perhaps fifty, and the others were alsosettling in after the rush of the start. We were climbing steadily now andthe pace was slowing. I felt my legs come back to me, the numb excitementreplaced by the rhythm of a long hard run¡ªsteady steady steady steady, upon my toes as the hill steepened. Police cars rolled their lights in front of thepack. Far ahead, groups of school kids were trying to cheat, jumping intothe race with a lead of a hundred yards, but the cops pulled them out as theydrove past.

The entire first half was uphill, and by the time I took the lead, perhapstwo minutes into the race, I could see that the others were finished. It wasa varied field¡ªcollege students and danwei workers and a few athletes whoclearly could have been good runners with more training¡ªbut all of themwere done. Quickly I slipped ahead.

To lead any big race is a strange feeling. People speak of the lonelinessof running, but I¡¯ve always felt that the sport is lonely only in the races, andespecially when the pack breaks and you find yourself alone in front. In thepack you usually feel some solidarity with the other athletes, even thoughyou are still competing, but in front there are no illusions. That¡¯s when therace becomes a chase¡ªone man against the rest of the field¡ªand I¡¯ve alwaysfelt that this is the loneliest feeling in the world. And it¡¯s even lonelier whenyou are the only foreigner in a field of more than two thousand, and all alongthe course spectators are calling out ¡°Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.¡±

Out-of-country person, out-of-country person, out-of-country person.

I looked back. Behind me I could see the rest of the field¡ªan endlessstream of people, a black-haired mob. The main pace car had slowed and Iwas following a few strides behind its flashing lights. I looked back again,so I would remember the strangeness of the scene. The hill was steep now,climbing toward the pointed tower of the Monument to the RevolutionaryMartyrs. The street was lined with spectators and I could hear the wave ofsurprise as I passed; they were talking excitedly and exclaiming with amazement.

¡°Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.¡±

And I thought: Not today. If you¡¯re looking for people who are out of theircountry, out of place, out of step, out of shape, awkward, clumsy; if that¡¯swhat you¡¯re looking for, look back there. Look for the ones who started toofast, or the men who have smoked too many Magnificent Sound cigarettes,or the people who are wearing too many clothes and are choking with heatand sweat. Don¡¯t look at me¡ªI¡¯ve done this for many years in many places,and always it has been exactly the same. There are no referees, no languagebarriers, no complicated rules of etiquette. All you do is run.

By the turnaround I had more than thirty seconds on the next runner, andI took it easy from there. The second half was all downhill, and because it wasan out-and-back course I passed the rest of the field. The ones who weren¡¯ttoo exhausted joined in the chorus: ¡°Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.¡± Butit didn¡¯t bother me a bit, because for those four kilometers I felt completelyat home.

FOR THE VICTORY I won two pairs of polyester sports uniforms, bothtoo small, with the characters for Fuling City inscribed proudly on the chest.

I also received a certificate testifying that ¡°Comrade He Wei,¡± my Chinesename, had won the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to Welcome Spring.

The race organizers awarded me twenty yuan, and the college gave me fivefor participating on its team. They also gave me one and a half yuan forundergoing the medical exam, which made me wonder how much I couldhave made if I had agreed to the chest X ray. All told I cleared twenty-sixand a half yuan, which paid for two weeks of noodle lunches.

I was on the local TV news for the following week, and the next day¡¯s paperfeatured a front-page story about the race. They reported that an Americanteacher from Missouri named H.Essler had participated, and there wasa detailed description of the way I had warmed up before the start. They reportedthe excitement of the college representatives when I finished in firstplace, and they quoted one of the other top finishers, a young man fromthe medicine factory who said, ¡°If this race had been right after my militarytraining, I definitely would have beaten that foreigner.¡± The end of the articleread:

The competition also succeeded in establishing patriotism in sports. Whenour reporter asked, ¡°What are your thoughts about a waiguoren finishingfirst,¡± a Trade School student named Xu Chengbo said: ¡°To have a sportscompetition in a Chinese area and allow a waiguoren to take first place, Ifeel very ashamed. This gives us a wakeup call: our students and adults needto improve the quality of their bodies, because if we improve our strength,we can be victorious!¡±¡­A Southwest Military School teacher said: ¡° Thewaiguoren took the initiative, and that sort of spirit deserves to be studied.

Only if we plunge into developing our bodies, and have more diligent andscientific training, will we see the day when we achieve the championship!¡±

It wasn¡¯t exactly the reaction I had hoped for, although I wasn¡¯t surprised.

There was a great deal of patriotism in Fuling, and sports always made thesefeelings particularly intense. That was why the basketball had been such afailure, and sometimes I wondered if it had been a bad idea to run in the race.

A few of my Peace Corps friends thought that at least I shouldn¡¯t have tried towin. But I liked running races hard, just like many others in the competition,and I saw no reason to treat the people in Fuling like children. I wanted themto know that waiguoren were living in their city, and I wanted them to seethat despite all my struggles with the language, there was at least one thing Icould do well. If they reacted with shame, that was unfortunate, but perhapswhen they grew to know me better it would be different. I figured it was agood sign that my certificate read ¡°Comrade He Wei.¡±

A few days after the race, I had class with Teacher Liao, who beamedwhen we started the lesson.

¡°I saw on the department message board that you won the long race inFuling!¡± she said. ¡°I hadn¡¯t heard¡ªwhy didn¡¯t you tell me?¡±

¡°It¡¯s not important,¡± I said. ¡°In fact, I didn¡¯t run very fast at all.¡±

¡°Yes, you did!¡± she said, doubly pleased by my false modesty, whichfollowed the appropriate Chinese custom. ¡°That¡¯s a very big race¡ªin all ofFuling City, you are the fastest person!¡±

¡°There are probably better athletes who didn¡¯t participate,¡± I said. ¡°Andyou know, Wang Junxia is still faster than me.¡±

Wang Junxia was the Chinese woman distance runner who had recentlywon gold and silver medals in the Atlanta Olympics, and this reference madeTeacher Liao even happier. She praised me again, and finally we settleddown to a chapter on how to say goodbye. Either I did unusually well or shewas in a particularly forgiving mood; on that day she hardly said budui atall.

3.1 THE WHITE CRANE RIDGETODAY THE YANGTZE RIVER is two inches higher than it was in midwinter1,234 years ago. The intervening years have witnessed other changes¡ªthepassing of five imperial dynasties; the arrival and departure of the Mongols,the Manchus, the British, the Japanese; the construction of the Great Walland the destruction of the Cultural Revolution; the Great Leap Forward andthe Reform and Opening; the development of the Three Gorges Dam from ahalf-formed dream to the biggest building project in China¡ªbut despite allof these changes the level of today¡¯s Yangtze is exactly two inches higherthan it was in 763. Two inches in 1,234 years.

This is the story that is told by the White Crane Ridge, an eighty-yardlongstrip of sandstone that sits like a temporary island in Fuling¡¯s harbor.

At most the ridge emerges from below the muddy skin of the Yangtze forfive winter months, in the heart of the dry season, and the ridge does notappear at all if the year is unusually wet. When it does emerge, the sandstonespeaks¡ªtwenty-two pictures and over 300,000 characters are engraved onits surface. Along the nearly four thousand miles of the Yangtze¡¯s length,there is no other place where man has left such a vivid record of the river¡¯slife.

Nobody knows for certain when the ridge was first used in this way, butvirtually all of the carvings refer to a pair of stone carp that are engravedat the bobbing waterline of the river. Each fish is nearly two feet long andthey swim one after the other, heading westward, their bellies forming a linethat represented the low-water mark at the time of their engraving. In thehooked mouth of the forward carp is a lotus blossom. These fish were carvedsometime in the Tang Dynasty before the year 763, which is the date of thefirst engraved reference to their appearance. This afternoon, the level of theYangtze is just a touch higher than the line of the carp.

The original purpose of the fish was practical rather than artistic. Neverwas the Yangtze more dangerous to boats than in winter, when low waterexposed shoals and crags. Pilots passing Fuling could study the White CraneRidge, note the water level in comparison to the twin carp, and predict thecondition of the river ahead. The fish swam in place; the river constantlyfluctuated; the locals understood this relationship and it became part of theYangtze¡¯s annual pattern.

Over the years, other dynasties left their own engravings on the ridge,most of which note the return of the Tang fish. Just above the two carp, aNorthern Song Dynasty carving greets their appearance in the year 971: ¡°Thewater of the river retreats. The stone fish are seen. Next year there will be abumper harvest.¡± Ten feet higher on the ridge, time suddenly leaps three anda half centuries to 1333, when Yuan Dynasty officials note the Tang carp¡¯sreturn: ¡°In Fuling the appearance of the stone fish indicates a great harvest,guarding the prefecture for the next year.¡±

Most of the carvings follow this ritualized form¡ªthe date of the carp¡¯ssighting, followed by a harvest prediction, all of which is inscribed in thename of the emperor. Central to this ritual was the belief that the appearanceof these Tang fish was associated with harvests, and eventually theWhite Crane Ridge shifted from a navigational tool into an oracle of themysterious and vital cycles of the natural world. And pinned through thesenever-ending cycles was the straight line of human history, as the representativesof emperor after emperor left their marks on the rock.

The ridge was only one of dozens of annual signs that were recordedin this way by the emperor. He was the Son of Heaven, a representativeof the unspeakable forces of nature, and yet the manifestation of these sameforces¡ªan earthquake, a flood, a famine¡ªcould signal that heaven had turnedagainst a ruler and his dynasty. The emperor embodied what he could notcontrol and did not understand. As a result, he sought refuge in ritual, andthe Fuling government officials regularly engraved the stone in the name oftheir ruler, despite the broken and weathered paragraphs of old that testifiedto lost dynasties and forgotten emperors. And the springtime rising of theYangtze, the swollen river sweeping over the characters, gave evidence thatthere were forces the emperor could only watch, and that his glorious titles,like the inscriptions, were nothing more than words.

And so it goes with the Yuan. The 1333 inscription speaks optimisticallyof a bumper harvest, but the dynasty is already on the decline, having slippedfrom what was the largest empire the world has ever known¡ªthe empire ofKublai Khan, the Mongol-ruled China that Marco Polo visited. But by 1333,Marco Polo is long gone, and Kublai Khan is dead, and the power of the Yuanis fading. Their officials carve bravely onto the stone, but the dynasty hasonly thirty-five more years before the wash of time covers it forever.

DOCKED ON THE SOUTH SIDE of the White Crane Ridge are three sampans.

The boats are wood, with arched roofs of bamboo and woven reeds.

Each roof is less than three feet tall at the highest point, reducing wind dragand avoiding a structure that could tip the craft, which has no keel. The boatsare light and narrow, low-gunneled, with virtually no freeboard, and theyare easily maneuvered in the river¡¯s current. Their design has not changedgreatly since people first began carving on the rock to which the sampansare tethered.

Four women chat in the prow of a boat. All of them wear simple jacketsof blue, and their clothes, like the boats, are dirty. They are river peoplewho live on their sampans; for most of the year they depend on fishing, butwinter fish are sluggish and the owners of these crafts spend the season onthe ridge. They rely on tourism, using small rowboats to ferry visitors backand forth from shore.

Today is a holiday and more than fifty visitors are wandering up anddown the sandstone, gazing at the inscriptions. Occasionally they will ask aquestion of one of the eight workers stationed on the ridge, who have beensent here by the Fuling City Cultural Relics Administration. Two of thesestaff members have some formal education in archaeology, while the othersare common workers whose job is to sell snacks, oversee the rowboats, and,for two yuan, take photographs of visitors next to the ridge¡¯s biggest carvedfish.

A cold wind runs down the corridor of the river valley, and the workershuddle around their snack table, shivering and drinking hot tea. They watchthe Yangtze closely, measuring its level every day. Undoubtedly they dreamof the river rising, because whenever it covers the carvings they can returnto the indoors work of their government office in town. For them, the appearanceof the stone carp augurs nothing more than long cold days of exileout on the river.

To a certain degree this is appropriate, because a number of inscriptionswere made by government officials who for various infractions had been exiledto Fuling. It was the sort of place that made for a good punishment¡ªalonely river town far from the heart of the empire, a post where communicationsbroke down and the civilized world slipped away. One carving wasmistakenly made in the name of an emperor who had actually already died.

News of his passing had not yet made its way down the Yangtze, and so localofficials didn¡¯t realize that they were the subjects of a new ruler.

And while Fuling sometimes represented the end of a political career, theridge is testimony that other pursuits could flourish here. Poetry and calligraphywere the traditional pastimes of the lonely exile, and many of thelocal officials left inscriptions that are works of beauty. Toward the westernedge, four characters are inscribed with particular style: ¡°The River RunsForever.¡± This carving¡¯s exact date is unknown; it was made sometime duringthe Kuomintang period, in the 1930s or 1940s, and the calligraphy¡¯sdistinctive loops and curves are of the ¡°running grass¡± script style. The lastcharacter, nian, trails off in a long straight line that points like a dagger atthe river below.

Perhaps the ridge¡¯s most famous calligraphy consists of four large charactersless than twenty feet from the Tang carp. These words are stacked oneon top of the other, and they follow the flowing form of the ¡°running hand¡±

style. Moss grows green in the ruts of the inscription, which says, ¡°PillarRock in Midstream.¡±

The author, Xie Bin, was a celebrated calligrapher in the Fuling area,where his skills earned him the nickname Sacred Hand. He carved the phrasein 1881, during the Qing Dynasty, and the elegant inscription calls to mindthat period more than a century ago, when the pillar rock holds steady butChina is in trouble. The Opium Wars have been fought and lost; the GreatTaiping Rebellion has been put down at enormous expense. European powerscontrol ports all along the Chinese coast. Government money to modernizethe navy is being diverted to build a new pleasure palace for Cixi, the EmpressDowager. Thirteen years from now, the Japanese will invade Korea, takingboth the peninsula and southern Manchuria. But the White Crane Ridgeemerges as it always has, and Fuling¡¯s Sacred Hand leaves his graceful mark.

A Russian-made hydrofoil streaks past the north side of the rock, headingtoward Chongqing. The boat¡¯s wake rises and swamps the lower section ofthe ridge. Tourists scamper to higher ground, laughing, and the water breakswhite over the characters and engraved fish. Then the waves subside, andthe carvings are clear once more, and the river runs the same way it has runforever.

4 The DamI TAUGHT MY WRITING CLASS from a Chinese-published text called A Handbookof Writing. Like all of the books we used, its political intent was neverunderstated, and the chapter on ¡°Argumentation¡± featured a model essayentitled ¡°The Three Gorges Project Is Beneficial.¡±

It was a standard five-paragraph essay and the opening section explainedsome of the risks that had led people to oppose the project: flooded sceneryand cultural relics, endangered species that might be pushed to extinction,the threat of earthquake, landslide, or war destroying a dam that would holdback a lake four hundred miles long. ¡°In short,¡± the second paragraph concluded,¡°the risks of the project may be too great for it to be beneficial.¡±

The next two sentences provided the transition. ¡°Their worries and warningsare well justified,¡± the essay continued. ¡°But we should not give upeating for fear of choking.¡± And the writer went on to describe the benefits¡ªmore electricity, improved transportation, better flood control¡ªandconcluded by asserting that the Three Gorges Project had more advantagesthan disadvantages.

I had some moral qualms about teaching a model persuasive essay whosetopic had been banned from public debate in China since 1987¡ªthis seemeda slap in the face to the very notion of argumentation. At worst it was anexercise in propaganda, and at best it didn¡¯t seem particularly sporting. But Ihad nothing else to work with, and the truth was that the essay, apart from itspolitical agenda, provided a good structural model. My job was to teach thestudents how to write such a composition, and so I went ahead and taughtit. I reckoned there was no sense in giving up eating for fear of choking.
